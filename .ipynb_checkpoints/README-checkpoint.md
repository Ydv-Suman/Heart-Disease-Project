❤️ Heart Disease Prediction
Can we predict whether someone has heart disease based on their medical information?

This project uses machine learning to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on clinical features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

🔍 Problem Statement
Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not they have heart disease?

📁 What’s in the project?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

Machine Learning Model Training

Model Evaluation and Comparison

Visualizations of Results

🧪 Models Used
Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest Classifier

All models are evaluated and compared using accuracy scores.

📊 Dataset
The dataset includes features like:

Age

Sex

Resting Blood Pressure

Cholesterol

Fasting Blood Sugar

Maximum Heart Rate

Exercise-Induced Angina

ST Depression

The target column shows whether the patient has heart disease:

1 → Disease

0 → No disease


🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

numpy

pandas

matplotlib & seaborn

scikit-learn

📌 Goal
To create a simple, effective model that can support early heart disease detection using basic patient data.
